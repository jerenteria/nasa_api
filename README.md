# Welcome to my NASA 🚀 API WEB APP 🪐 👽 
Hi and Welcome to my NASA API Web Application! This project was built by using and authorized API token from Nasa 🚀 themselves! 
I was able to get data queries by sending GET requests to NASA 🚀 and getting the data response in a json format. I was then able to store the data in 
a variable, which then allowed me to return and render it in HTML. All the data being printed out is all current, so feel free to check it out!
